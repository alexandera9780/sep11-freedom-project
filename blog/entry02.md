### Content
Over the last few weeks of tool learning, I've decided to take a step back and learn something a little bit easier. I finally learned how to download my tool onto my IDE. I had to copy the download text onto my command line. Then, I decided that I wanted to learn what ```npm``` and ```nvm``` do. However, there is a long list of things that npm and nvm can do, so I'll try to keep the list short. We can use npm to install packages and updates onto our command line, with ```npm install <name of package>```. Things like ```npm start```, and  ```npm test``` automate the things that they say in the name. Something like ```npm audit``` can be used to help fix problems in the code. The other line of code, nvm allows you to download and switch between versions of node with ```nvm install``` and ```nvm use <version>```. Then we have ```nvm list```, which tells you which versions we have downloaded, ```nvm current```, which tells you which one you have active, and ```nvm alias default <version>```. I've also seen from many different pieces of code, commands like ```import```, ```from```, and ```await```, but I haven't started researching what that does yet.


### Takeaway
One takeaway I tended to have over the last few weeks is that progress can be small little steps or it could be big crazy milestones. All of that just depends on how good you retain information and how rushed you are. Some weeks I make lots of good progress, like the week I figured out what npm and nvm were, and how I was supposed to use them. However some weeks there was much less progress, but there was still some progress, like the week I figured out how to download node onto my IDE. Regardless of how much progress I made that week, progress is still progress, and it's better than not doing anything at all and not making any progress.

### EDP
Based on everything I've done so far in my learning and processing, I think I'm still in the first part of the engineer design process. I am still in the process of defining things in my tool, and I'm still stuck on questions that would do me lots of good if and when they're answered. I haven't quite made it to the brainstorming part of the engineer design process yet, but within the next few weeks I think I will make it more towards part two of the EDP.
