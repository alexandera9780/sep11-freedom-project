In the very beginnings of our Freedom Project, we have focused on a lot of the planning and comfirming of our tools. After some deciding I decided I would make my Freedom Project a 2D platform game that would help you study for AP Chemistry with my partner, Edward. My first big hurdle came with deciding on a tool. Originally,  my plan was to use Animejs, which I would've used to make the visuals much better, but after I found out it wouldn't work well with my partners Kaboom.js, I had to go in a different direction. After getting help from Mr. Mueller about a tool, I was given the idea to make an API from scratch that could hold Multiple Choice problems and their answers. After that I did my own digging into what would be the best thing for me to get started on doing, and what website I should be using, and what came up was Node.js, which is supposed to be a great backend API.
